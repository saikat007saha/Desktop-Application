###File manager inside an office. You can edit, share files over the network using a very simple to use tray application. 
 
Plugged is an easy-to-use application that can replace your default windows credential based file and media sharing feature. It is a tray application on which you can drag and drop any file and it will be available for download for anyone in the network.

###Replaces your default Windows Network File Sharing :

Installing this program is a simple task but, if you encounter any errors, check your computer to see if it has .NET Framework installed since it cannot work without this software framework.

Once launched, Plugged creates an icon in the systray, which shows a list of all wireless networks in your range when clicking

it. Once you connect to a Wifi network, you can start sharing files which will be stored against the router's MAC address on the server. Any other user on the same network can now use this to retrive this file.

###Send file request to users who are not even online:
Asking for a file using this program means the user who has the file should be online. If the user is unavailable for some reason, it takes the request on queue and whenever the user next comes online, the file gets downloaded. Furthermore, it can be extended to customise who all can access the file that one is sharing. Most of the logic is on the backend. 

###No internet is required for file transfer
The file transfer mechanism uses UDP and TCP protocol and takes over the local network. The objective of the whole process it to save internet usage for file transfers inside an office.
