###Wifi manager that auto-switches to connections with better signal, runs speed tests, shows potential connectivity issues and the number of devices connected to your network:


 
Plugged is an easy-to-use application that can replace your default wireless connection manager built into the operating system, in order to enhance its functionality. For example, it displays the number of devices currently linked to your network and can perform a speed test to evaluate your upload and download rate.

###Replaces your default Windows wifi manager:

Installing this program is a simple task but, if you encounter any errors, check your computer to see if it has .NET Framework installed since it cannot work without this software framework.

Once launched, Plugged creates an icon in the systray, which shows a list of all wireless networks in your range when clicking

it. In addition to the network name and connection signal, it displays the amount of used data and number of devices currently linked to the same connection as you.

###Shows potential wifi issues and auto-connects to networks with a better signal:
Connecting to a network using this program means selecting a network from the list and entering the password if it's protected. If a connection is unavailable for some reason, it shows possible problems to help you figure out a solution, such as "No Internet access" or "DNS Server Down". Furthermore, it can automatically switch to an access point with a better signal strength. There is no option available for disabling this.

###View the number of devices connected to your network and run speed tests
This list can be refreshed with the click of a button. Moreover, you can run a speed test to determine the download and upload rate of the network you're currently connected to. This is a good indicator to help you decide which network to pick if you have multiple options at hand. However, it involves connecting to each network to calculate the download and upload rate, which can take a while.
